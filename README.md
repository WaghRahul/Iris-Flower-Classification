# Iris Flower Classification

***Overview:***
Developed a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor) using sepal and petal measurements.

***Key Features:***
- Utilized the Iris dataset with 150 samples and four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier for supervised classification.
- Achieved perfect classification accuracy (1.0), correctly classifying all data points.
