# Iris-Flower-Classification

Description:- The project "Iris Flower Classification" is a machine learning project that aims to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project uses the well-known Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples from three different species of iris: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. The project uses a supervised classification approach, where the target variable is the species of the iris. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training and evaluation. The project uses a Logistic Regression classifier to train the model and achieves a flawless classification on the provided dataset, with an accuracy score of 1.0, indicating that it correctly classified all data points.
